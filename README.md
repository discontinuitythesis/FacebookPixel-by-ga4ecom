## The Problem This Solves

Most Facebook Pixel templates were built for Universal Analytics and don't work properly with GA4's new ecommerce data structure. This leads to:
- ‚ùå Missing conversion data
- ‚ùå Broken ecommerce tracking  
- ‚ùå Poor campaign optimization
- ‚ùå Frustrated marketers

**This template fixes all of that.**

## Super Simple Setup

### Just 2 Tags Needed:
1. **Base Pixel** - Tracks page views
2. **Ecommerce Events** - Tracks all purchase, cart, checkout events automatically

### Smart Trigger System:
- **One regex trigger** handles all ecommerce events
- **No multiple triggers needed** - keeps your GTM container clean
- **Automatic event mapping** from GA4 to Facebook

## Quick Start

1. **Download** the `template.tpl` file
2. **Import** to GTM: Templates ‚Üí New ‚Üí Import 
3. **Create 2 tags** using the template
4. **Test** with GTM Preview mode
5. **Publish** and start tracking
